    <h1>Database indexing and searching</h1>
    <h2>An index is an ordered (or indexed) subset of table columns, with each row entry 
pointing to its corresponding table row. Generally speaking, introducing indexing into 
your MySQL database development strategy gives you three advantages:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Query optimization</li>
    <li>Uniqueness</li>
    <li>Text searching: full-text indexing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example of full text index</h2>
<pre>
<code>
SELECT * FROM products WHERE MATCH(description) AGAINST ('phone');
SELECT * FROM products WHERE MATCH(description) AGAINST ('processor');
SELECT * FROM products WHERE MATCH(name,description) AGAINST ('processor');

SELECT * FROM products WHERE description LIKE '%processor%';
</code>
</pre>
