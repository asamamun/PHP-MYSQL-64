        <div class="shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 bg-body-tertiary rounded">July Movement will remain a memorable chapter in the history of Bangladesh forever. Because about 1500 fresh lives have been lost through this movement. In addition, more than 30 thousand people have lost their body parts and are now crippled and crying in the hospital. The July Movement started with the demand to abolish the quota system in government jobs.

          According to the circular of 2018, all types of quotas were canceled in government jobs, but in 2024, the circular was canceled through a writ of the High Court, as a result of which all students, including Dhaka University, broke down in anger. As a result of this, the anti-discrimination student movement started. After this movement started in intense form on July 1, the government attacked the BCL students at Dhaka University on the 15th to suppress the students. Thousands of students were injured as a result. As a result, anger spread in every educational institution across the country.</div>

          <div class="shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 bg-body-tertiary rounded">July Movement which is termed as the second independence of Bangladesh. Because in 1971 the brutality shown by the Pakistani forces on the Bengalis, in July 2024 the autocratic government carried out similar brutality on the common people of Bangladesh just to stay in power. When the general student crowd took to the streets to demand the abolition of all types of quotas in government jobs, the government deployed its party forces to make the students leave the streets. On July 15, the Chhatra League attacked ordinary students at Dhaka University and injured thousands of students. As a result, the students of all kinds of educational institutions of Bangladesh took to the field and on July 16, Rangpur University student Abu Saeed was martyred by police firing. By this means the news of the first martyrs of the July revolution spread across the country and the general student crowd became more revolutionary and the movement gained more intensity. The result of which was the end of 16 years of autocracy and Sheikh Hasina’s government had to flee the country secretly. Through this, Generation G got the taste of Bangladesh’s second independence. Bangladesh gained independence for the second time on August 5, ending the history of 16 years of autocracy.</div>
